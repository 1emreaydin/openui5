			Overview
		</h1>
		<p>
			Cards are small user interface elements which provide the most important information from an application
			related to
			a specific role or task in a compact manner allowing for actions to be executed. Cards can be described as
			small
			representations of an application which can be put in different systems (for example, widgets). Cards can
			also be
			used as any other UI5 control.
		</p>

		<p>Cards consist of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A card container - a white background and a border with radius which holds the header and the content.
			</li>
			<li>A header - the header can have a title, a subtitle, an icon, and a status indicator. If the header is of
				type
				Numeric, it may have different attributes, describing numeric indicator, like KPI for example.
			</li>
			<li>Content - depends on the card type.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Advantages of cards over tiles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Decoupled from Components</li>
			<li>Flexible size</li>
			<li>Support progressive disclosure [TBD]</li>
			<li>Provide actions</li>
			<li>Described in a technology-agnostic way (using JSON)</li>
		</ul>

		Card is a self-contained user interface element, connected to a manifest and used as a widget.

		<p>The application developer and the card developer are two different people. The card developer is responsible
			for the
			card and its content, whereas the application developer is responsible for integrating the card in the
			application
			without having to configure the card in any special way (using it as a self-contained component, as a
			widget). This
			case is technology-agnostic, which means that the card created should be integratable with different host
			environments and technologies.</p>
		<p>An application developer user story:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>As a JAM developer</li>
			<li>I want to add a SuccessFactor card</li>
			<li>so that the user does not
				have to switch applications to do a task
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A card developer user story:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>As a SuccessFactor developer</li>
			<li>I want to create a card</li>
			<li>So that other lines of businesses can integrate
				the SuccessFactor functionality in
				their applications (in a UI5 agnostic way).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			To integrate the card (as described in the above use case), the application developer must load
			sap.ui.integration
			library and use sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card. This card is self-contained and is similar to UI5's
			ComponentContainers. The difference is that the card is much lighter as it does not necessarily instantiate
			a
			Component. It is sufficient for a card to have a manifest and it will render as a self-contained user
			interface
			element (the same way as the ComponentContainer will).
		</p>
		<p>In the manifest the card developer can specify:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The header type (e.g. Numeric), properties and actions
			</li>
			<li>The content type (List, Analytical, etc..), data source and actions
			</li>
			<li>How the data source response is bound to the card properties
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To learn more about the manifest schema, go to Schema
		</p>
		<p>You can use the sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card by passing the path to the card manifest:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
<xmp class="language-xml">
<mvc:View xmlns:w="sap.ui.integration.widgets">
<w:Card manifest="./demo/manifest.json"/>
</xmp>
</pre>
		<p>or if the manifest is already loaded, you can take it from a model:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
<xmp class="language-xml">
<w:Card manifest="{manifestAsObject}"/>
</xmp>
</pre>
		<p>One of the benefits of the manifest approach is that every technology can understand a JSON object and render
			a card
			based on it.
