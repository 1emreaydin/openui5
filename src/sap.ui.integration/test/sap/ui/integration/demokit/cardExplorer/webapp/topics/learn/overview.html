		<h1 id="overview">Integration Card Overview</h1>
		Integration Cards are a new way to expose application content in a unified way to the end user. <br>
		Depending on the use cases Cards can be embedded in a host environment like application, dashboard or any HTML page, easily.
		A variety of Card types can be configured by a simple JSON configuration (schema) without the need to write code for UI Rendering.
		With that even users without programming skill can be enabled to create new Cards for their special needs.


		<h2>Card Configuration</h2>
		Based on a JSON schema definition, a card author defines either static card content or dynamic content from REST services.
		The upcoming design-time capabilities of Cards will help the author in the future.

		<h2>Host Environment</h2>
		The host environment is responsible to integrate a Card. Action events allow the host environment to react on user interactions
		within the Card.
		For HTML environments UI5 provides two ways of integration, as a Custom Element or as a UI5 control.

		<h2>Card Types</h2>

		<h3>Component Card</h3>
		For more flexible implementations of Card content, the Component Card allows to integrate UI5 Components as content.
		Such Card could only be rendered within a HTML host environment.

			UX Concept
		</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>Cards are representations of an app or page, and offer content to users in a specific context.</li>
			<li>Cards contain a certain set of information from an app or page and can also offer functionality.</li>
			<li>Cards can be a mash-up of multiple apps (such as a list card with links).</li>
			<li>An app or page can be represented by one card, or by multiple cards that each expose different aspects.</li>
			<li>Users get direct insights without leaving the current screen, but cards can still offer further navigation options.</li>
			<li>Cards are composite controls that follow a predefined structure.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Cards consist of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A card container - a background and a border which holds the header and the content.
			</li>
			<li>
				A header - it can have a title, a subtitle, an icon, and a status. If the header is of
				type Numeric, it may have different attributes, describing numeric indicator, like KPI for example.
			</li>
			<li>
				Content - depends on the card type.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="characteristics">
			Characteristics
		</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Technology agnostic - Different technologies can easily parse the manifest.json file and render a card based on it.</li>
			<li>Self-contained - Everything needed to render the card and make it actionable is described in the manifest.json (including data and functionality).</li>
			<li>Reusable - The manifest.json can be easily parsed, processed and saved in different layers of an application. It is also easily sharable.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="developingCards">
			Developing Cards
		</h1>
		<p>
			To create a card you should create a manifest.json file which stores all configurations (card structure, data, functionality, etc...).
			sap.card is the namespace responsible for the card configuration inside the manifest file.
